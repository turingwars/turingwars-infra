# Docker-based TuringWars infrastructure

**WIP: TODO next: load mysql creds securely**

To start the server, run:
```
./start.sh
```

This pulls the latest release from github and runs it in docker.

Use this command instead if you want to run the code from a local clone of the [turingwars/turingwars](https://github.com/turingwars/turingwars) repository.

```
./start.sh --source path/to/local/turingwars
```
